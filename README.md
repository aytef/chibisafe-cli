# chibisafe-cli
A simple cli/shell script to install and manage your chibisafe instance

Check out [Pitu](https://github.com/pitu) and the [Chibisafe](https://github.com/chibisafe/chibisafe) project, they're awesome!

## How to use?
Just download the bash script and upload it into your desired installation folder.
For example in your `home` directory.

Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x chibisafe-cli
```

Run it via 
```
./chibisafe-cli
```

## ⚠️ Experimental Usage ⚠️
Please use this with care. I've tested it only on Debian 12 machines.
The best case would be a freshly installed VPS or virtual machine to use this script on.
It will install all dependencies (as root) but i'm considering building it in user-mode/sudo.
